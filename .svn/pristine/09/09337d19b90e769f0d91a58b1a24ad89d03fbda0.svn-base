This is a note for generating ATMPD Monte Carlo data using skdetsim.

                                                    K. Okumura

 1)  Compile skdetsim binary
     
      detail procedure for compiling is written in "release_note" file
      located in the same directory, "skdetsim/doc".

      Note: since skdetsim for atm. nu consume memory much, you should compile 
      binary with "HIGH" option. Also it should run on "atmpd" queue, where 
      memory limit is loose.


 2)  Check skdetsim.card

      official skdetsim card for atmpd is :

           SK-I      sk1_odtune.card
           SK-II     sk2_odtune.card
           SK-III    sk3_odtune.card
           SK-IV     sk4_odtune.card

      if you want to generate events from vector file, check 
      'VECT-FILE' configuration in card file. it should be "0".


 3)  Specify subrun number 

       set subrun number of MC data in skdetsim.sh. subrun number can be 
      set by :

       >  setenv MC_SUBNUM 0

       this is needed because bad channel of MC data depends on the subrun 
      number. there are ten patterns and badch are set when skread is called.
      the choise of pattern is determined by (subrun#)%10. so in order to 
      generate all patterns equally, you have to generate MC for number 
      of files multiplied by ten. 

       at the same time, when you read MC data, 26 and 27 should be 
      included in the argument of "skopt" subroutine. 

         27 : set bad channel for atmpd MC  
         26 : set bad channel for data
  

 4)  Run skdetsim

      ./skdetsim_high.sh [card name] [output file] [input file]
