This document summarizes the mdifications made to SKdetsim to implement KL->KS regeneration 
used for the p->muK0 search. (see note below)


klksregen.inc (newly added)
	common block for klks regeneration. This file is where KLKSLIFE_H20 is set by the
	user and where regeneration can be enabled by setting KLKSENABLE.

gutrak.F
	at the beginning of the track determine the lifetime for klks regeneration (KLKSLIF)

gtneut.F (newly added)
	copied from /usr/local/cern/2005/src/geant321/gtrak and modified. Added regeneration
	in same way that decay is treated. (see detail below)

klksregen.F (newly added)
	called when regeneration occurs. Stops tracking of the KL and creates the new KS 
	daughter particle with same momentum and direction. 

gustep.F
	allow truth information from mechanism code 42 (KL->KS regeneration) to be 
	written to the output bank.

GNUMakefile
	added gtneut.o and klksregen.o

Note regarding KL->KS regeneration:

Regeneration in GEANT (SKDETSIM) 
 
        KL->KS regeneration is off by default in the SKDETSIM. 
        KL->KS is treated as a decay mode of the KL. I copied the same code 
        GEANT uses to handle particle decay and used this for KLKS regeneration. 
        The decay lifetime, KLKSLIFE_H20=120E-7 (seconds), is an adjustable parameter. 
         
        At the beginning of each particle track, the lifetime of regeneration for  
        that track, KLKS_LIF, is determined as: 
                KLKS_LIF = -CLIGHT*KLKSLIFE_H20*LOG(RNDM(1)) 
        where CLIGHT is the speed of light, RDNM(1) is a random number between 0 and 1.  
        This is done in gutrack.F.               
 
        At each step in the tracking of the particle, regeneration is considered for KL in  
        gtneut.F. The regeneration length, KLKSREGL is calculated: 
                KLKSREGL = KLKSLIF*VECT(7)/AMASS 
        Where VECT(7) is the momentum of the KL and AMASS is the mass. If this length is less  
        than the current distance tracked then regeneration occurs. If regeneration occurs then 
        the KL particle type is changed to KS but the other kinematics remain the same  
        (mom, dir etc...). The regeneration mechanism flag is set, IPROC=42. 
 
        To determine the value of KLKSLIFE_H20=120E-7 (seconds), I used 100% KL as  
        input to the SKDETSIM and changed the lifetime parameter, KLKSLIFE_H20, until  
        the fraction of output events with KL->KS regeneration was 0.1%
