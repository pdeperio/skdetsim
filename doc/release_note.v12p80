These are release notes for skdetsim v12.80.
Ed Kearns Aug 8, 2011

This version updates the SKDETSIM version number from 11.79 to 12.80.
This is an update of both LEVER (11->12) and APVER_MAJOR (7->8) and
APVER_MINOR (9->0, not 9->10). This AP version number system is
strange, but several people were asked (Kameda, Okumura, Miura, Mine)
and we did not find external software that would be affected. It may
be that APVER_MAJOR ad APVER_MINOR is a left over from APDETSIM.

As for code that does connect to APDETSIM, Mine-san did point out the
use of APDSLIBVER by the energy scale group. This should be made the
same numver in water.aveX. This version number is unrelated to the
skdetsim version number. It is a simple hard-code inside skmkmcver.F
(currently 5.2, 6.1, 7.2, 8.2 for SK 1-4). The commenting is confusing
as it is called "Monte Carlo Version Number" and "apdetsim version".

Changes to skdetsim that I am aware of:

LOWE: time dependent water parameter (Yokozawa)

ATMPD: pion charge exchange bugfix (Patrick)

ATMPD: OD tuning

ATMPD: photon yield factor (COREPMT)

Take note that the previous skdetsim version had two tags:

skdetsim-v11p79/
skdetsim-v11p79_for_atmnu_apr10/

If any other information related to this version (12.80) is
discovered, please update these release notes.

For instructions on use of SKDETSIM, please see previous release
notes.
