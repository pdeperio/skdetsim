Release note for SKDETSIM ver.10.78 
September 4th, 2009 written by Jun Kameda for SKDETSIM group.

 We updated SKDETSIM, and version number is updated to 10.78 .
 
 A. What is updated.

 The major modification after last version v9.77 
 (released 2009 June collaboration meeting) is as follows:

 (1) Water coefficients are updated using laser injector data. (T.McLachlan)

      The "water parameters" are implemented for every month from Oct.08 to Aug.09.
      If you want to use a parameter set for specified month,
      please add a line to card file like this:

       DS-WATERP 200811
     
      This is for Nov.2008, for example. If you don't set, or you set not-supported
      number, the water parameter will be set to that of Apr.2009.

 (2) Z-dependent absorption coefficient is implemented. (T.Yokozawa)

      The Z dependence of the absorption coefficient is obtained
      from Ni data in Apr.2009. If user want to include this effect, please add
      two lines to card file as follows:

       DS-MTBA 1
       DS-TBA 10.03

      The number "10.03" is a tuned number for SK-IV.

 (3) Timing resolution for SK-IV is implemented. (Heng Yang)

 (4) Tuning of the Black-sheet using direct measurement data (J.Kameda).   

      The black-sheet model used in SK-III LE_TUNE was too shiny, and
      tuned using direct measured data in SK-III.
     
 (5) Automatic changes of the tracking method from 3 to 4 
     for over 1TeV neutrinos                    (J.Kameda)

      To avoid a crash of the SKDETSIM due to a shortage of the memory,
      SKDETSIM can automatically change the photon-tracking mode to
      memory-saving mode (TRACK_PHOTON = 4). 
      Currently, this function works only if user selects TRACK_PHOTON=3 originally.

      If user want to enable this function, please add a line to card file:

       SKCNTL-TRACKAUTOSW 1

      After generating 1TeV neutrino event with TRACK_PHOTON=4, it will 
      automatically go back to original TRACK_PHOTON mode.

 (6) Example card files are updated.

     Example card files, sk4_odtune.card and le_sk4_example.card are updated.
     They included the parameters above. (TRACKAUTOSW is only in sk4_odtune.card).
